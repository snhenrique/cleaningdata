## README.md

This project comprehends a R script called run\_analysis.R that does the
following:

1.  Download UCI HAR Dataset.zip from
    <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

2.  It has data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung
    Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site
    where the data was obtained:
    <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>

On this data, the script run\_analisys.R perform the following:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.

3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set

4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
    subject.

## Project content:

1.  Tidy data set.

2.  Code book.

3.  Source code of run\_analisys.R.

4.  This Readme file.
